# Invertible RIM

Official Pytorch implementation of the code accompanying the 2019 NeurIPS paper 
[*Invert to Learn to Invert*](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8336-invert-to-learn-to-invert)
by Patrick Putzky and Max Welling.

This package supplies methods for defining invertible models in Pytorch, 
a wrapper class that enables *invert to learn* on such invertible models, and
a reference implementation for the i-RIM. A number of examples demonstrate how to 
use the package.

This work was used for the model that won the singlcoil track in the [fastMRI challenge](https://fastmri.org). 
Training and evaluation code for the fastMRI problem can befound [here](https://github.com/pputzky/irim_fastMRI).

## Installation

This package requires pytorch>=1.3. In order to install invertible_rim,
run the following commands 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pputzky/invertible_rim.git
cd invertible_rim
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

### Package structure
1. **examples**
    
   A number of examples for demonstrating the usage of this package. 
   The focus is on the usage of irim.core.
    
2. **irim.core**

   This is the core of the package. It implements all components necessary to 
   build an i-RIM and to train it using *invert to learn*. This module can easily 
   be extended with other invertible layers and modules.
   
3. **irim.rim**
   
   A reference implementation of the [Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04008)

4. **irim.test**
   A number of tests for module invertible_rim.irim. You can run
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
   to confirm that *invert to learn* is numerically stable on your system.
